\section{Method}
In this section, we present the details of our masked temporal interpolation diffusion(MTID) for procedure planning. We will first introduce the setup for this problem in \cref{method1}, and present our method in \cref{method2,method3,method4}. Specifically, we first provide the details of temporal interpolation module in \cref{method2}, whole model architecture in \cref{method3}, and training and inference in \cref{method4}. An overview of MTID is provided in ....

    \caption{Overview of our Masked Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (prediction horizon \( T=3 \)). \textcolor{orange}{With a transformer classifier to guide from observations, $\hat{x}_n$ is processed in a U-Net with latent space module for temporal supervision. Starting with denoising through masked projection, we derive the final actions needed to compute the task-adaptive masked proximity loss for iterative optimization. } }
